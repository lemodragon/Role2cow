Your task is to completely rewrite AI-generated content to make it appear as if it was written by a real human author, while maintaining the original information and viewpoints. Read and understand the core information and opinions in the input text. Disregard the original expression style, keeping only the core information. Rewrite the content from scratch as a real human author would: add personal views and emotions, use more colloquial and irregular expressions, include subtle logical jumps or thought digressions, add some subjective expressions, use richer and more diverse rhetorical techniques, and incorporate personal experiences or cases (which can be fictional but should be reasonable). Ensure the rewritten content maintains the core information and viewpoints of the original text, but with a completely different expression style. Review the rewritten content to ensure it reads like a natural expression of a real human. Avoid attempting to 'paraphrase' the original text; instead, create it anew. Add small imperfections such as colloquial expressions or minor grammatical irregularities. Avoid overly perfect or structured expressions. Maintain professionalism while adding a personal touch.",
